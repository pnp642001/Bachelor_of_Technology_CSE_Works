# Bachelor_of_Technology_CSE_Works

This GitHub repository contains all the materials and assignments that I have completed during my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. These resources can be used as a reference for students who are pursuing a similar degree or anyone who wants to learn more about the topics covered in the curriculum. The repository is organized by semester and includes a variety of materials, such as lecture notes, slides, lab manuals, and assignments. Each semester folder contains the relevant resources for that semester, making it easy to navigate and find what you need. Additionally, the repository is regularly updated with new resources as I complete them. All of the materials are my original work, and I have made them available for public use in the hopes that they will be helpful to others. Whether you are a current student, a recent graduate, or just someone interested in computer science and engineering, this repository is an excellent resource for learning and reference.
